# Contributing

nb:group develops an open source, community-driven projects. If you'd like to contribute, feel free
to do this, but remember about following rules.

## Branching strategy

- For bug fixes base your changes on the oldest maintainable branch.
- For new features without backward compatibility (BC) issues base your changes on the oldest
  maintainable branch (if there is no reason to base it on another one).
- For new features with BC issues __always__ base your changes on the newest maintainable branch.
- When you create a pull request (PR), always select the branch your code based on as target.
- Before submitting your PR, please rebase your branch on the target branch.

## Standards (PHP)

- Our code standard based on PSR-12, but includes more detailed rules.
- For code style checks, formatting and static analyze we use the following tools:
  - PHP-CS-Fixer
  - PHP_CodeSniffer
  - PHP Mess Detector
  - PHP Magic Number Detector
  - PHPStan
  - Phan
  - Psalm

### nb:group Auditor

For your convenience there is [nbgrp/auditor](https://hub.docker.com/r/nbgrp/auditor) docker image
that allows to run all necessary checks at once. It is based on the GrumPHP tool and used on every
push into the repository to validate it. You can run container based on this image (if you have
installed `docker`) by command

```composer nba```

## Tests

- You MUST run tests before push your code into the repository.
- You SHOULD write (or update) unit tests that cover your code.
- You MAY write (or update) bad unit tests.

## Documentation

You SHOULD write (or update) documentation.
